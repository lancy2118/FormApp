INFORMATION

    The form has 4 input fields and a submit type button. All fields are required with the exception of 'Address 2'. The UI should prevent the user from submitting the form unless all required fields have been filled. Invalid fields should be highlighted in red. Once all data has been entered, the submit button should trigger an alert dialog and output the data the user has entered.
